            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>½ cups milk</li>   
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) in a heavy skillet.</li>
            <li>Beat milk and eggs together in a large bowl. Combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture until smooth.</li>
